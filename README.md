### Presentation

This conference is in honor of Peter Tallos 70th birthday. 

Peter is an internationally renowed researcher in the field of differential inclusion. Peter was the head of the Department of Mathematics of Corvinus University of Budapest for long years. He is an excellent teacher, he always belonged to the most popular teachers of Corvinus University of Budapest. At the same time, Peter is a long term managing editor of [P.U.M.A.](https://sciendo.com/journal/PUMA), founded by Jenő Szép and Franco Migliorini.

Celebrating Peter's 70th birthday a special issue of P.U.M.A. is edited by the organising comitee of this conference.
An excerpt from the Foreword written by his colleage Péter Medvegyev is as follows.

*,,Peter was there and he served the department and the students with great care and devotion. For more
than 20 years he served as head of the department and director of the different
organizations containing the math department.*

*Perhaps his main characteristic is that he was not just working for the institution but he was really serving it. Peter is an excellent teacher, who obviously
has a great charisma. To teach mathematics for economists is not an obvious
task. Generally most of the students just want to pass the exam. But when
Peter was teaching the students did not want just pass, they also wanted to
understand mathematics. The main reason is that he was very deeply under-
standing the fundamental message of mathematics and gave the students exactly
what they needed to get. Appreciation of clear thinking. But Peter is not only
an excellent teacher but he is a good researcher. In this volume his colleagues
and friends have published some articles related to his research interest.
In my article one can find some reflections on a problem which I have founded
most interesting when I joined the department about twenty years ago. This
time after István Dancs he was the head of the department, and the math department had a very friendly and open atmosphere. The main characteristic
was that the members of the department loved their work, loved teaching, loved
mathematics and of course loved teaching mathematics very much.*

*We discussed everything. From very abstract questions of mathematics to very basic axiomatic issues. 
We have tried to fly and we have tried to dig as deep as we could. 
Whenever I went to the department somebody had some problem about some details of some proof or some definition. 
I liked that environment and perhaps for all of us this was the happiest part of our professional life.*

*In this special issue I try to recall the atmosphere of these lovely years.''*
