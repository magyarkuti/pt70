### Presentation

This conference is in honor of the 70th birthday of Peter Tallos. 

Peter is an internationally renowned researcher in the field of differential inclusion. He was the head of the Department of Mathematics of Corvinus University of Budapest for long years. Peter is an excellent teacher, who always belonged to the most popular teachers of Corvinus University of Budapest. At the same time, Peter is a long term managing editor of [P.U.M.A.](https://sciendo.com/journal/PUMA), founded by Jenő Szép and Franco Migliorini.

Celebrating Peter's 70th birthday a special issue of P.U.M.A. is edited by the organising committee of this conference.
An excerpt from the Foreword written by his colleague Péter Medvegyev is as follows:

*,,Peter was there and he served the department and the students with great care and devotion. For more
than 20 years he served as head of the department and director of the different
organizations containing the math department.*

*Perhaps his main characteristic is that he was not just working for the institution, but he was really serving it. Peter is an excellent teacher, who obviously
has a great charisma. To teach mathematics for economists is not an obvious
task. Generally most of the students just want to pass the exam. When
Peter was teaching the students did not want to just pass, they also wanted to
understand mathematics. 
The main reason of this is that he was very deeply understanding the fundamental message of mathematics, and gave the students exactly what they needed to get: appreciation of clear thinking. 
But Peter is not only an excellent teacher, he is a good researcher as well. 
In this volume his colleagues and friends have published some articles related to his research interest.
In my article one can find some reflections on a problem which I have founded most interesting when I joined the department about twenty years ago. 
This time, after István Dancs, Peter became the head of the department. 
The math department had a very friendly and open atmosphere. 
The main characteristic was that the members of the department loved their work, loved teaching, 
loved mathematics, and they very much loved teaching mathematics.*

*We discussed everything. 
From very abstract questions of mathematics to very basic axiomatic issues. 
We have tried to fly and we have tried to dig as deep as we could. 
Whenever I went to the department somebody had some problem about some details of some proof or some definition. 
I liked that environment. Perhaps for all of us this was the happiest part of our professional life.*

*In this special issue I try to recall the atmosphere of these lovely years.''*
